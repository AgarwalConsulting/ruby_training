class: center, middle

Here you are trying to *learn* something, while here your *brain* is doing you a favor by making sure the learning doesn't stick!

---

### Some tips

- Slow down => stop & think
  - listen for the questions and answer

- Do the exercises
  - not add-ons; not optional

- There are no dumb questions!

- Drink water. Lots of it!

---

### Some tips (continued)

- Take notes
  - Try: *Repetitive Spaced Out Learning*

- Talk about it out loud

- Listen to your brain

- *Experiment!*

*A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.*

## Why Ruby?

.content-credits[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/]

---
class: center, middle

Ruby is a *dynamically-typed*, *object-oriented*, *expressive* & *elegant* programming language.

---

### `Hello, World!`

In file, `hello.rb`:

```ruby
name = "Rubyist"

puts "Hello, #{name}!"
```

```bash
$ ruby hello.rb

Hello, Rubyist!
```

Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro ‚ÄúMatz‚Äù Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (`Perl`, `Smalltalk`, `Eiffel`, `Ada`, and `Lisp`) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

Monkey Patching (Flexibility)

---
class: center, middle

Ruby *closures* resemble *Lisp* functions

---
class: center, middle

Ruby features single inheritance only

---
class: center, middle

Ruby often uses very limited punctuation and usually prefers English keywords, some punctuation is used to decorate Ruby

---

- Ruby has exception handling features, like Java or Python, to make it easy to handle errors.

- Ruby features a true mark-and-sweep garbage collector for all Ruby objects. No need to maintain reference counts in extension libraries. As Matz says, ‚ÄúThis is better for your health.‚Äù

- Writing C extensions in Ruby is easier than in Perl or Python, with a very elegant API for calling Ruby from C. This includes calls for embedding Ruby in software, for use as a scripting language. A SWIG interface is also available.

---

- Ruby can load extension libraries dynamically if an OS allows.

- Ruby features OS independent threading. Thus, for all platforms on which Ruby runs, you also have multithreading, regardless of if the OS supports it or not, even on MS-DOS!

- Ruby is highly portable: it is developed mostly on GNU/Linux, but works on many types of UNIX, macOS, Windows, DOS, BeOS, OS/2, etc.

## Pass by value

---

- Methods with a `=` suffix are for setters.

- Methods with a `?` suffix will return a boolean.

- Methods with a `!` suffix mean one of two things: either the method operates destructively in some fashion, or it will raise and exception instead of failing.

- In documentation, `::method_name` denotes a class method, while `#method_name` denotes a instance method.
